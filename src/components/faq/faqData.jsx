          Landwind is first conceptualized and designed using the Figma software
          so everything you see in the library has a design equivalent in our
          Figma file.

    question: " What are the differences between Landwind and Tailwind UI?",

        <p className="mb-2 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
          The main difference is that the core components from Landwind are open
          source under the MIT license, whereas Tailwind UI is a paid product.
          Another difference is that Landwind relies on smaller and standalone
          components, whereas Tailwind UI offers sections of pages.

        <p className="mb-2 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
          However, we actually recommend using both Landwind, Landwind Pro, and
          even Tailwind UI as there is no technical reason stopping you from
          using the best of two worlds.
